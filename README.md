I've added some functionalities:
- input validity check for the "rock, paper, scissors" question,
- instead of choosing "p", "k" or "n", input "q" to quit the game,
- input validity check for the "play again" question,
- console clearing after every round for clarity,
- player choice information,
- round counter.
